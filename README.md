# BasicEncryptor_v1.0
A website (go to page) that can encrypt and decode messages with the built in encryption.

  This is version 1.0 and the encryption is very basic, however, 
in the future I plan to make the encryption so extreme that a 
human cannot desifer it. (ya know, unless they use the website)

  The HTML is very basic because this is a early prototype and
I don't want to get carryed away with styling and what no until I finish the encryption.
