    <h1><ins><i>Encrypter and Decoder</i></ins></h1>
    <p><i> By Duncan W. Hass </i></p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If you have came here to find a basic encrypation, maybe to mess with your friends,
        maybe to send a secert message, or maybe you just have clicked on a link some guy
        from the JavaScript subreddit (thanks for visting), you have came to the right place!
    </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So here are the basic rules for using, when you type in the code you would like to be encrypted
        or decoded, DO NOT press enter, press the "encrypt" or "decode" button right away. Pressing enter 
        would just earse the text box. I will fix this in a later version. You also cannot, at least in the current version, use anyform of puncuation.
        These will include exclamation marks, question marks, periods, commas, etc. (spaces do work though)
        The code will just ingore it and would skip it when giving you the output. This sadly includes numbers so, for now, please spell out numbers fully. 
        I will attempt to add numbers in later. Also, the reset button will instantly clear the text box for so use that instead of removing it manually.
        Enjoy my little website!
